# GraphicsAssessment

This project is a demonstration of graphics and UI in Unreal Engine 4.

This project consists of two levels, the first demonstrating character locomotion and the second demonstrating a GUI that interacts with the world.

In both levels, use WASD to move around the scene. In the first, move the mouse to rotate the camera, but in the second you will need to click and drag to rotate the camera as the mouse cursor is used for GUI elements.

To run the project, navigate [here](https://github.com/drewfunderburk/GraphicsAssessment/releases/tag/v1.0) to get the build and download it. Once the download is complete, unzip the file and run the GraphicsAssessment executable.
